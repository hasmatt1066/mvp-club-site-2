It doesn't belong to engineers or early adopters. It's a reflection of all of us, and the people getting the most from it are the ones who recognize that and claim it as their own.</strong></p>\n<p>AI is for all of us. And I mean that literally.</p>\n<p>These tools were trained on our data. Yours, mine, everyone's. Decades of us writing, asking questions, sharing what we know, figuring things out online. AI is the amalgamation of all of that \u2014 a reflection of us, collectively. Not any one person's genius or stupidity. All of ours.</p>\n<p>And yet so many people feel like AI isn't for them. Like it belongs to someone else. That assumption is the single biggest barrier to AI adoption \u2014 and it's based on a misunderstanding of what these tools actually are.</p>\n<h2>Why was AI trained on everyone's data?</h2>\n<p><strong>Large language models were trained on the broadest possible sample of human knowledge \u2014 billions of web pages, books, articles, forums, and conversations spanning every industry, domain, and field of expertise. This means AI reflects the collective knowledge of virtually every profession, not just the technical fields.</strong></p>\n<p>When people hear \"AI was trained on data,\" they often picture something technical \u2014 server rooms and datasets. But what that actually means is more human than it sounds. AI learned from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nurses discussing patient care on forums</li>\n<li>Teachers sharing lesson plans</li>\n<li>Accountants explaining tax strategies</li>\n<li>Marketers debating campaign approaches</li>\n<li>Managers writing about team dynamics</li>\n<li>Researchers publishing findings</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Every field. Every domain. Every kind of problem-solving humans have discussed online. The data that trained these models came from all of us, and it reflects all of us.</p>\n<h2>Why do people think AI isn't for them?</h2>\n<p><strong>Most people assume AI is a technical tool for technical people \u2014 because that's how software has traditionally worked. But AI is fundamentally different. It's a communication tool that understands natural language, built from broad human knowledge. The barrier isn't technical skill \u2014 it's the assumption that you need technical skill.</strong></p>\n<p>There's a pattern I see constantly in coaching. Someone shows up nervous, maybe even skeptical. They assume AI is for people with coding backgrounds or engineering degrees. They've tried ChatGPT once, gotten a mediocre answer, and concluded it wasn't for them.</p>\n<p>Then we start working together. They describe a problem from their actual work \u2014 in their own words, using their own domain language. And AI responds with knowledge that's clearly drawn from their field. It understands their terminology. It knows the common challenges. It can reason about their specific situation.</p>\n<p>That moment of recognition is powerful. \"Wait \u2014 it knows about THIS?\"</p>\n<p>Of course it does. People in their field contributed to the data it was trained on. Their colleagues, their industry publications, their professional communities \u2014 all of it fed into the model. AI already speaks their language. They just hadn't been introduced yet.</p>\n<h2>What does it mean that AI is a collective resource?</h2>\n<p><strong>AI is arguably the largest collective resource humanity has ever created \u2014 an amalgamation of our shared knowledge that no single person or organization could have built alone. Recognizing it as collective changes how we think about who has the right to use it and benefit from it.</strong></p>\n<p>Think about what we've built here. For decades, humanity has been pouring knowledge onto the internet. Every how-to article, every forum answer, every professional discussion, every research paper. Individually, each contribution is small. Collectively, it's the most comprehensive knowledge base ever assembled.</p>\n<p>AI tools take that collective knowledge and make it accessible through conversation. You don't need to know which specific article has your answer. You don't need to search through thousands of results. You describe your problem in plain language, and AI draws on that vast collective knowledge to help you.</p>\n<p>This isn't someone else's genius. It's not a proprietary invention you're renting access to. It's the collective output of millions of people \u2014 including you \u2014 made useful in a new way.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Traditional Software</th>\n<th>AI Tools</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Built by a company's engineers</td>\n<td>Trained on everyone's knowledge</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Does what it was programmed to do</td>\n<td>Responds to any domain or problem</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>You learn the tool's interface</td>\n<td>The tool understands your language</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Specialized by design</td>\n<td>General by nature</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>How does seeing AI as collective change how you use it?</h2>\n<p><strong>When you see AI as a collective resource rather than someone else's tool, you stop asking for permission and start claiming it. You bring your real problems, your actual domain expertise, and your specific context \u2014 and you discover that AI was waiting for exactly that kind of input.</strong></p>\n<p>The shift happens when people stop treating AI like a foreign tool and start treating it like a resource that already understands their world. Instead of generic prompts, they bring their real work:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A project manager describes their actual workflow bottleneck</li>\n<li>A recruiter shares a real job description they're struggling with</li>\n<li>A small business owner walks through their actual customer journey</li>\n<li>A teacher explains their specific classroom challenge</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Every one of these people has domain knowledge that AI was trained on. When they bring that knowledge to the conversation, the interaction transforms from \"using a tool\" to \"thinking with a partner that understands your field.\"</p>\n<h2>What does this mean for the future of work?</h2>\n<p><strong>The future of working with computers isn't reserved for engineers \u2014 it's opening up to everyone. AI makes technical capability accessible to anyone who can communicate clearly about what they need. The data we all created is becoming a tool we can all use to create things in domains we previously thought inaccessible.</strong></p>\n<p>This is the future of working with computers. Not just for some of us \u2014 for all of us. The doors that used to require years of specialized training to even knock on are opening.</p>\n<p>People are building apps who've never written code. Creating marketing systems who've never used a CRM. Analyzing data who've never opened a spreadsheet formula. Not because AI is doing it for them \u2014 but because AI is translating their vision and domain expertise into capabilities they couldn't access before.</p>\n<p>And claiming this together is the only way it makes sense. Because AI was built collectively, it should be claimed collectively.</p>\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n<h3>Do I need technical skills to benefit from AI?</h3>\n<p><strong>No. AI is a communication and management tool, not a technical tool. You describe what you need in your own words, evaluate the output, and iterate. The skills that matter are clear communication, knowing what you want, and being willing to practice \u2014 the same skills that make someone a good manager.</strong></p>\n<h3>Is AI really trained on data from my specific industry?</h3>\n<p><strong>Almost certainly yes. AI models were trained on the broadest possible sample of human knowledge online, including professional forums, industry publications, academic research, and practitioner discussions from virtually every field. If people in your industry have discussed their work online, AI has learned from it.</strong></p>\n<h3>Why does AI sometimes give bad answers if it has all this knowledge?</h3>\n<p><strong>AI is probabilistic \u2014 it generates responses based on patterns, not perfect recall. Getting good results requires learning to steer the conversation with clear context, specific questions, and iteration. The knowledge is there; the skill is in drawing it out effectively. This gets easier with practice.</strong></p>\n<h3>How do I get started if I've been assuming AI isn't for me?</h3>\n<p><strong>Start with a real problem from your actual work. Describe it in your own words \u2014 use your domain language, your terminology. Don't try to sound \"technical.\" AI already understands your field. The first step is simply bringing your real work to the conversation and seeing what happens.</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Claim It Together</h2>\n<p>AI is a collective resource we all contributed to. The people getting the most from it aren't the ones with the deepest technical skills \u2014 they're the ones who recognized it as theirs and started using it.</p>\n<p>At MVP Club, we help people make that shift. From \"this isn't for me\" to \"this was built from people like me.\" If you're ready to claim your seat at the table, join us.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mvp-club.mn.co/\">Join MVP Club \u2192</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Written by Matt Hastings, PhD in Education, co-founder of MVP Club.
