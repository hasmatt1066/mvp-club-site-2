  "content": "<p>There's a reason so many people feel like AI \"isn't for them,\" and it's not because they're not technical enough or because they missed the boat two years ago. It's because they're trying to learn AI the way they learned every other professional skill—and that approach just doesn't work here.</p>\n<p>Think about how you learned project management, or whatever tool defined your early career. You took a course, you practiced, you got competent, and then you more or less moved on. Maybe you took a refresher every few years. The skill stayed relatively stable, and so did you.</p>\n<p>AI doesn't work like that. There's no \"competent\" state you reach and coast from. The tools shift, the capabilities expand, and what was impossible six months ago is now a Tuesday afternoon. And here's where most people get stuck—they see that constant change and think, <em>I'll never catch up, so why bother starting?</em></p>\n<p>I get it. I lived it.</p>\n<p>Last year, I stepped away from all of this for about three months after a loss in my family. When I finally came back, I told my co-founder Matt that maybe I should just stop—I'd missed too much, the landscape had shifted while I was gone, and it felt pointless to try to catch up. He convinced me otherwise, and he was right.</p>\n<p>Because here's what I've learned: there is no \"caught up.\" That's not the game. The game is staying in motion.</p>\n<p>For me, that looks like about two hours a week dedicated to understanding what's new—what tools have dropped, what's changed, what people are excited about. We do a tooling deep dive every Monday in our community, which helps. That's my \"staying current\" time. But the real learning happens in my actual work. I'm not practicing AI on the side and then applying it later—I'm using it to do my job (writing, building workflows, solving problems) and learning through the doing. When something better comes along, I switch. When a tool doesn't fit, I drop it.</p>\n<p>It's not about mastering anything. It's about staying loose, staying curious, and letting the learning happen inside the work instead of before it.</p>\n<p>If you've been sitting on the sidelines thinking you're not technical enough, or you've missed too much, or it's all moving too fast—I want to offer you a different frame. You don't need to catch up. You just need to start moving. And you don't need to do it alone (that's kind of the whole point of what we're building).</p>\n<p><strong>→ <a href=\"https://mvp-club.mn.co\">Come check us out</a></strong></p>"
