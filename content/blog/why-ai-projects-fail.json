  "content": "<p>Everyone has access to AI tools now. ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini—they're all a click away. And yet most organizations that try to \"adopt AI\" fail to see meaningful results.</p>\n<p>The numbers are brutal: 95% of AI projects don't deliver on their promise.</p>\n<h2>The training trap</h2>\n<p>Most companies respond to AI by scheduling training sessions. They bring in consultants. They create workshops. They produce slide decks explaining what AI can do.</p>\n<p>And then nothing changes.</p>\n<p>Here's the problem: <strong>understanding AI isn't the same as using AI</strong>. You can sit through a hundred presentations about how ChatGPT works without ever developing the muscle memory to actually use it effectively in your daily work.</p>\n<p>It's like watching cooking shows and expecting to become a chef. The knowledge doesn't transfer without practice.</p>\n<h2>What actually works</h2>\n<p>The organizations that succeed treat AI adoption as a <strong>practiced skill</strong>, not a knowledge transfer problem.</p>\n<p>This means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Daily use, not occasional experiments</li>\n<li>Coaching, not just training</li>\n<li>Starting with real work problems, not hypothetical examples</li>\n<li>Building habits over weeks, not checking boxes in a day</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The path forward isn't more information. It's structured practice with support.</p>\n<h2>The human advantage</h2>\n<p>Here's the thing most people miss: <strong>AI doesn't replace you—it amplifies you</strong>.</p>\n<p>The goal isn't to hand your job over to a machine. It's to figure out what you're uniquely good at and use AI to do more of it. Human + AI beats either alone.</p>\n<p>This is why we say AI adoption is an emotional journey as much as a technical one. It requires rethinking your relationship to your own work and capabilities.</p>\n<h2>Getting started</h2>\n<p>If you're trying to figure out AI adoption for yourself or your team, start small:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pick one task you do repeatedly</li>\n<li>Try doing it with AI assistance for a week</li>\n<li>Notice what works and what doesn't</li>\n<li>Iterate</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The path forward reveals itself through action, not preparation.</p>"
