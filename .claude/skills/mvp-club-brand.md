## Core Thesis

**AI adoption is a practiced skill.** It requires daily use, discipline, and coaching to develop. This is not a training problem—it's a practice problem. The barriers to adoption are primarily emotional, motivational, and time-based, not technical.

**Human + AI > Human OR AI.** An AI-augmented workforce will outperform an AI-replacement workforce. The sum is greater than the parts. Some work is worth offloading to AI, but this moves the Human+AI system up the value chain—it doesn't eliminate the human.

## The Human + AI Philosophy

### Core Belief
AI augments human capability—it doesn't replace human judgment. The goal is to move humans up the value chain by offloading appropriate work to AI, freeing people for higher-leverage contributions.

### Key Concepts
- **Managerial relationship**: You're the manager. AI is a capable direct report. You set goals, provide context, and evaluate outputs.
- **Vision over understanding**: Sometimes knowing *what* you want matters more than knowing *how* it works. AI lets you offload understanding to reduce friction.
- **Practice creates understanding**: You won't understand AI by reading about it. You understand by using it daily. "We make the road by walking."
- **Do first, understand later**: Unlike traditional tools, AI rewards action over preparation.

### What We Advocate For
- Human creativity + AI execution
- Human judgment + AI speed
- Human context + AI capability
- Human vision + AI implementation

## Quick Reference: The MVP Club Test

Before publishing any content, ask:

1. **Does it lead with the human, not the tech?**
2. **Does it invite rather than lecture?**
3. **Does it acknowledge the journey takes time?**
4. **Does it avoid fear-based motivation?**
5. **Would a skeptical, time-strapped professional feel welcomed?**

If yes to all five, it's on-brand.
