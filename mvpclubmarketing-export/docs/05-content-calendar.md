## Overview

---

## Content Pillars

All content should align with one of these five themes:

### 1. The AI Adoption Crisis (Problem)
**Purpose:** Establish the problem we solve
**Topics:**
- Statistics on AI project failures
- Why training doesn't work
- The gap between AI access and AI capability
- What enterprises are getting wrong
- The hidden costs of failed AI adoption

**Example hooks:**
- "95% of AI projects fail to deliver ROI. Here's why..."
- "Your company gave everyone ChatGPT. Six months later, nothing changed."
- "The AI training your company just paid for? It won't work."

### 2. Practice > Training (Philosophy)
**Purpose:** Differentiate our approach
**Topics:**
- Why daily practice beats one-time training
- The discipline of AI adoption
- Making time for practice when you're busy
- Building AI habits, not AI knowledge
- Why courses don't create capability

**Example hooks:**
- "You don't get fit by reading about exercise."
- "I've done 100+ AI coaching sessions. The #1 thing that predicts success..."
- "Training teaches you about AI. Practice makes you capable with AI."

### 3. Human + AI Teams (Thesis)
**Purpose:** Share our unique perspective
**Topics:**
- The managerial relationship with AI
- Vision vs. understanding
- Augmentation over automation
- Moving up the value chain
- Do first, understand later

**Example hooks:**
- "I used to think AI was a tool. Now I manage it like a direct report."
- "You don't need to understand how AI works. You need to know what you want."
- "An AI-augmented human will outperform an AI replacement. Here's why..."

### 4. Behind the Scenes (Proof)
**Purpose:** Demonstrate expertise through real examples
**Topics:**
- Real coaching session insights (anonymized)
- How we use AI in our own work
- Mistakes we've made and learned from
- Client transformations
- Day-in-the-life of AI coaching

**Example hooks:**
- "In yesterday's coaching session, something clicked..."
- "Here's the exact prompt I use to start every workday..."
- "A client came to me skeptical about AI. Three months later..."

### 5. Community & Connection (Social Proof)
**Purpose:** Build desire for community
**Topics:**
- Member wins and stories
- Why going through this together matters
- Community highlights
- What members are building
- The support system people need

**Example hooks:**
- "This week in our community, someone shared a breakthrough..."
- "AI is going to be the most disruptive moment of our careers. Better together than alone."
- "I asked our community: What's the one thing that made AI click for you?"
