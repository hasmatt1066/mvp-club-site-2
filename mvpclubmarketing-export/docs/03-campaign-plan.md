## Channel Tactics

### LinkedIn

**Posting Schedule:**

|---------|------------|------------|

| Ryan | 5 | Mon-Fri, 7am EST |
| Jill | 5 | Mon-Fri, 12pm EST |
| Company | 2 | Wed, Fri |

**Post Formats That Work:**
1. Story → Insight → CTA
2. Contrarian take (challenge conventional wisdom)
3. "Here's what I learned from..." (experience-based)
4. List post (tactical tips)
5. Question/poll (engagement driver)

**Engagement Strategy:**
- Respond to every comment within 2 hours
- Ask follow-up questions to deepen conversation
- DM anyone who engages meaningfully
- Comment on relevant posts from others

### Email

**Sequence:**
| Email | Timing | Subject | Goal |
|-------|--------|---------|------|
| 1 | Week -1 | "Something's changing" | Tease launch |
| 2 | Day -3 | "Here's what we're building" | Preview offer |
| 3 | Day 0 | "We're live" | Launch announcement |
| 4 | Day 2 | "First reactions" | Social proof |
| 5 | Day 5 | "Last chance" | Urgency |
| 6 | Day 7 | "Founding members closed" | Final push |

### Discord → Mighty Networks Migration

**Strategy:**
1. Announce new community home
2. Offer exclusive founding member pricing to Discord members
3. Create urgency with migration deadline
4. Personal outreach to most active members

**Messaging:**
"We're moving to a new home that lets us do so much more. As a thank you for being here from the start, you get founding member access at $20/month—locked in forever."

### Direct Outreach (DMs)

**Who to DM:**
- People who engage with your posts
- Past coaching clients
- Connections who fit ICP
- Discord active members

**DM Template:**
```
Hey [Name],

I noticed you [engaged with my post about X / we connected at Y / etc.].

We're launching something I think you'd find valuable—a community
for professionals figuring out AI adoption together.

It's not a course. It's live coaching sessions twice a week,
async support, and a community of people going through the same thing.

We're doing founding member pricing ($20/mo, locked forever)
for the next [X] days.

Would you be interested in learning more?
```

## Objection Handling

### "I don't have time"
**Response:** "That's exactly why this exists. You don't have time to figure AI out alone. We help you use your limited time efficiently. Two hours twice a week, plus async support when you're stuck. That's it."

### "I'm not technical"
**Response:** "Perfect—that's who this is for. We work with non-technical professionals every day. The barriers aren't technical, they're about showing up and practicing. We guide you through that."

### "I can learn from YouTube/courses"
**Response:** "You've probably tried that already. How's it going? The problem isn't access to information—it's accountability, practice, and having someone to ask when you're stuck. That's what community provides."

### "What if it doesn't work for me?"
**Response:** "The only way it doesn't work is if you don't show up. And if after a month you're not finding value, we'll work with you to figure out why. We're coaches—we meet you where you are."

### "$20/month is a lot"
**Response:** "It's less than a single hour of consulting. You get 16+ hours of live sessions per month, plus async support. If you save even 2 hours of frustration per month, it's paid for itself."
