# MVP Club Brand Strategy

## Company Overview

**MVP Club** is a coaching company that helps white-collar professionals and enterprises adopt AI through practice-based coaching.

### What We Are
- A **coaching company** (not a training provider)
- **Peer experts** who guide professionals through career transformation
- **Embedded partners** who augment organizations' people
- **Community builders** creating space for practice and support

### What We Are NOT
- A training provider (we don't build courses)
- Content-focused ("sage on the stage")
- Point-in-time intervention (training events don't work)
- Technical gatekeepers

---

## Core Thesis

### The Problem
AI adoption is failing across enterprises:
- 95% of AI projects fail to deliver ROI
- 42% of companies have abandoned AI initiatives
- Only 36% of employees are satisfied with AI training they've received
- 60% of leaders need AI training by 2025 just to stay relevant

### Our Insight
**AI adoption is a practiced skill.** It requires:
- Daily use and discipline
- Coaching through emotional and motivational barriers
- Efficient use of limited practice time
- Community support ("better together than alone")

The barriers are NOT technical—they're emotional, motivational, and time-based.

### Our Solution
Embedded coaching that:
- Meets people where they are
- Guides through daily practice
- Makes AI personally relevant
- Builds confidence through doing

## The Human + AI Philosophy

### Core Belief
**Human + AI > Human OR AI**

An AI-augmented workforce will outperform an AI-replacement workforce. The sum is greater than the parts.

### Key Concepts

**Managerial Relationship**
Using AI is like managing a capable direct report:
- You set goals and provide context
- AI executes with capability
- You evaluate outputs and iterate
- Vision matters more than understanding every detail

**Practice Creates Understanding**
- You won't understand AI by reading about it
- Understanding comes through daily use
- The path forward reveals itself through action
- "Do first, understand later" is the right approach

**Augmentation Over Automation**
- Some work is worth offloading to AI
- This moves humans UP the value chain
- It doesn't eliminate the human—it elevates them
- Human creativity + AI execution = leverage

### Avoid These Tones

## The MVP Club Test

Before publishing any content, ask:

1. ✓ Does it lead with the human, not the tech?
2. ✓ Does it invite rather than lecture?
3. ✓ Does it acknowledge the journey takes time?
4. ✓ Does it avoid fear-based motivation?
5. ✓ Would a skeptical, time-strapped professional feel welcomed?

**If yes to all five, it's on-brand.**
