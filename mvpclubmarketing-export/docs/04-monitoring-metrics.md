```

### What to Look For

**Content that works:**
- High impressions + high engagement = viral potential topic
- Lower impressions + high engagement = strong but niche topic
- High DMs = topic that prompts action
- High saves = valuable reference content

**Content that doesn't:**
- Low impressions + low engagement = wrong topic or format
- High impressions + low engagement = clickbait hook, weak content
- No DMs = not prompting action

### Adjustments to Make

**If impressions are low:**
- Experiment with hooks
- Try different posting times
- Engage more in comments before posting

**If engagement is low:**
- Make content more specific/actionable
- Ask questions to prompt comments
- Share more personal stories

**If conversions are low:**
- Clarify the offer
- Add more CTAs in content
- Improve landing page
- Address objections directly
