# Process Idea

Turn a rough idea, voice memo, or quick note into polished content.

## Context

Use this when a founder has a rough idea—a voice memo, a few bullet points, a shower thought—that needs to become a real piece of content.

## Instructions

1. **Get the idea**: Ask user for:
   - The raw idea (text, or point to file in /marketing/inputs/ideas/)
   - Which founder's voice (Matt, Ryan, Jill)
   - Intended channel (LinkedIn, newsletter, community)
   - Any specific angle or framing they want

2. **Analyze the idea**:
   - What's the core insight?
   - Which content pillar does it align with?
   - What format would work best?
   - Is there a story or example to anchor it?

3. **Generate options**: Create 2-3 versions:

### Option A: [Format type]
```
[Full post/content]
```
**Why this works:** [Brief explanation]

### Option B: [Format type]
```
[Full post/content]
```
**Why this works:** [Brief explanation]

### Option C: [Format type]
```
[Full post/content]
```
**Why this works:** [Brief explanation]

4. **Recommendation**: Suggest which option is strongest and why

## Example Input → Output

**Input (rough idea):**
"something about how using AI is like having a really smart intern - you still have to manage them, give them context, check their work"

**Output:**

### Option A: Story Format
```
I used to think AI was a tool.
Like a fancy calculator or a search engine.

Then I realized I was thinking about it all wrong.

AI is more like a really smart intern:
- They're capable of great work
- But they need context
- They need clear direction
- And you still need to check their output

The relationship isn't "use a tool."
It's "manage a direct report."

Once I made that shift, everything changed.

I stopped asking "how do I prompt this?"
And started asking "how do I brief this?"

That's the difference between AI access and AI capability.

What's your relationship with AI—tool or team member?
```
**Why this works:** Story format, clear transformation, ends with engagement question

### Option B: Contrarian Take
```
Hot take: AI isn't a tool.

It's a team member.

Most people treat ChatGPT like Google—
type something in, get something out.

But the best AI users? They manage it.

They provide context.
They set clear goals.
They evaluate output.
They iterate.

Same skills you'd use managing a sharp junior hire.

AI capability isn't about prompting.
It's about management.
```
**Why this works:** Punchy, contrarian, challenges assumption

### Option C: Tactical List
```
5 ways using AI is exactly like managing an intern:

1. They need context
   Don't just ask for "a marketing email."
   Tell them who it's for, what tone, what goal.

2. They're eager but not strategic
   They'll do what you ask. Make sure you're asking the right thing.

3. You have to check their work
   Trust but verify. Always review output.

4. They get better with feedback
   "Not quite—try it more casual" works for AI too.

5. They won't tell you what to do
   You're still the manager. You set direction.

Once I started "managing" AI instead of "using" it,
my results 10x'd.
```
**Why this works:** Tactical, specific, immediately actionable

**Recommendation:** Option A is strongest—the story format creates emotional resonance and the transformation narrative is compelling.

## Output

Save final content to:
- /marketing/to-review/linkedin/[founder]/ (if LinkedIn)
- /marketing/to-review/newsletter/ (if newsletter)
- /marketing/to-review/community/ (if community)

Use naming format: `YYYY-MM-DD_topic-slug.md`

Ask user which version they prefer, or if they want elements combined.
