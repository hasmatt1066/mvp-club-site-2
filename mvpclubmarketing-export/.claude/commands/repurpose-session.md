# Repurpose Session

Full session repurposing: turn one live session into a complete content package.

## Context

This is the comprehensive version of transcript processing. Use this after a major session (demo day, workshop, community call) to extract maximum value.

## Instructions

1. **Identify the session**: Ask user for:
   - Session type (demo day, workshop, community call, coaching session)
   - Date of session
   - Transcript location (or ask them to provide it)
   - Key speakers/participants
   - Any specific moments they want highlighted

2. **Deep analysis**: Read the full transcript and identify:
   - **Breakthrough moments**: When someone "got it"
   - **Key questions asked**: These become content hooks
   - **Stories shared**: Real examples are gold
   - **Frameworks explained**: Teachable concepts
   - **Objections addressed**: FAQ content
   - **Quotable lines**: Short, punchy insights

3. **Generate full content package**:

### LinkedIn Content (5-8 posts)

Distribute across founders based on who spoke/led:

**Post types to include:**
- 1-2 Story posts (something that happened in the session)
- 1-2 Insight posts (key learning or framework)
- 1 Tactical post (specific how-to from session)
- 1 Question post (turn an attendee question into content)
- 1 Teaser for next session

### Newsletter Content

**Full newsletter draft including:**
- Subject line options (3)
- Opening hook
- Main content (session recap + key insights)
- Member spotlight or quote from session
- Upcoming events/sessions
- CTA (join community, book call, etc.)

### Community Content

**3 pieces:**
1. Session recap post (for those who missed it)
2. Discussion prompt (continue the conversation)
3. Resource share (any materials, links, tools mentioned)

### YouTube/Video Content (if applicable)

- Video title options (3)
- Description (SEO-optimized)
- Timestamps for key moments
- Thumbnail text suggestions

### Quotables & Graphics

**5-8 short quotes formatted for:**
- LinkedIn text posts
- Instagram/social graphics
- Newsletter pull quotes

Format:
```
QUOTE: "[The quote]"
SPEAKER: [Name]
CONTEXT: [Brief context]
VISUAL: [Suggestion for graphic treatment]
```
