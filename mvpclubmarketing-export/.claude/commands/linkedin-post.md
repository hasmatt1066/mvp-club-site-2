# LinkedIn Post

Quickly create a single LinkedIn post.

## Context

Use this for quick, one-off post creation when you have a specific topic in mind.

## Instructions

1. **Get the details**: Ask user for:
   - Topic or idea (can be rough)
   - Which founder's voice (Matt, Ryan, Jill, or Company)
   - Any specific angle or hook they want
   - Format preference (or let you choose)

2. **Generate the post**:

### Format Options

**Story → Insight (Best for: personal experiences, client stories)**
```
[Hook - surprising statement or question]

[Story - 2-3 short paragraphs]

[Insight - what you learned]

[CTA - question or invitation to engage]
```

**Contrarian Take (Best for: challenging assumptions, hot takes)**
```
[Bold opening statement]

[Why conventional wisdom is wrong]

[Your alternative view]

[What to do instead]
```

**Tactical How-To (Best for: specific tips, frameworks)**
```
[Problem or goal]

Here's how to [achieve X]:

1. [Step one]
2. [Step two]
3. [Step three]

[Why this works / closing thought]
```

```
[X] things I've learned about [topic]:

1. [Thing] - [brief explanation]
2. [Thing] - [brief explanation]

Which one resonates most?
```

**Question Post (Best for: engagement, starting discussions)**
```
[Context or observation]

[Open-ended question]

```

3. **Provide the post** with:
   - Full text ready to copy/paste
   - Character count (ideal: 1,200-1,500)
   - Suggested posting time
   - Which content pillar it serves
   - Hashtag suggestions (optional, use sparingly)

## Brand Checklist

- [ ] Leads with human, not tech
