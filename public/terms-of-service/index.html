    <p class="legal-caps">TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW:</p>

    <h3>8.1</h3>
    <p>MVP Club, its owners, officers, employees, agents, and affiliates shall NOT be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages, including but not limited to damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses, arising out of or in connection with your use of or inability to use MVP Club, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

    <h3>8.2</h3>
    <p>MVP Club's total liability to you for all claims arising out of or related to these Terms or your use of MVP Club shall not exceed the amount you have paid to MVP Club in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim, or one hundred dollars ($100), whichever is greater.</p>

    <h3>8.3</h3>
    <p>MVP Club is NOT liable for any content, advice, recommendations, opinions, or information provided by members, guests, or third parties within the community. All such content is the sole responsibility of the person who originated it.</p>

WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT MVP CLUB WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR SECURE, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THE CONTENT OR INFORMATION PROVIDED THROUGH MVP CLUB IS ACCURATE, COMPLETE, OR RELIABLE.</p>

    <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless MVP Club LLC, its members, managers, officers, employees, agents, and affiliates from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney's fees) arising from: (a) your use of MVP Club; (b) your violation of these Terms or the Code of Conduct; (c) your violation of any third-party right, including any intellectual property, privacy, or proprietary right; (d) any content you post or share through MVP Club; or (e) any dispute between you and another member.</p>

    <h2>11. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h2>

    <h3>11.1 Informal Resolution</h3>
    <p>Before filing any formal legal action, you agree to first contact MVP Club at hello@mvpclub.ai to attempt to resolve any dispute informally. Most disputes can be resolved quickly and amicably through direct communication.</p>

    <h3>11.2 Binding Arbitration</h3>
    <p>If we cannot resolve a dispute informally within thirty (30) days, any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of MVP Club shall be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration shall be conducted in Delaware, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

    <h3>11.3 Class Action Waiver</h3>
    <p class="legal-caps">YOU AND MVP CLUB AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not preside over any form of representative or class proceeding.</p>

    <h3>11.4 Small Claims Exception</h3>
    <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court for disputes within that court's jurisdiction.</p>

    <h3>13.4 Waiver</h3>
    <p>No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term. MVP Club's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
