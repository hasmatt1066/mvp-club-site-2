# MVP Club

> AI adoption coaching for professionals and teams. We help people bridge the gap between having AI tools and getting real value from them through practice-based learning and community.

## About

MVP Club is an AI adoption coaching organization. We work with individuals and teams who want to actually use AI effectively in their work — not just learn about it in theory. Our approach is practice-based: learn by doing real work with AI, not by sitting through training programs.

We were founded by practitioners who figured out AI adoption the hard way and now help others skip the common mistakes.

## What We Do

### For Individuals
- Weekly community workshops and tool exploration sessions
- Peer learning with other AI practitioners
- Hands-on practice building real things with AI
- Join at: https://mvp-club.mn.co/

### For Organizations
- 4-Week Productivity Sprint: Install AI workflows into your team's real processes
- Week 1: Workflow Discovery — identify high-value use cases and define success metrics
- Weeks 2-3: Build + Install — create tailored AI workflows and train by doing actual work
- Week 4: Measure + Expand — quantify gains and plan next steps

## Our Approach
- AI adoption is a practice skill, not a knowledge problem
- 95% of AI projects fail to deliver ROI because organizations treat it as a technology rollout instead of a behavior change
- We focus on installing AI into real workflows, not running training programs
